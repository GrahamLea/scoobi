This is a maintenance release for Scoobi

### Improvements

 * improved the diagnostic messages for the existence of configuration files
 * added a glob pattern for the cat command in the repl
 * checking read/write permissions [#189](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/189), pull request by Jeff Zhang
 * made the Scoobi REPL `ls`/`cat` support multiple filesystems
 * added `avrocat` to the Scoobi REPL
 * improved the naming of the Scoobi job and the individual MapReduce jobs ("steps")
 * a DObject can be directly read from a path without triggering a MapReduce job [#288](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/288)
 * added `repl:assembly` to build a fat jar for scoobi-repl (and `repl:dist` to build a tar ball containing the script and fat jar) [#292](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/292)
 * added a `reduceValues` method to avoid using combiners after a `groupByKey`

### Fixes

 * prevented accidental division by zero errors in `TaggedPartitioners` and when composing `Grouping` instances
 * made the cat and avrocat commands lazy [#293](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/293)
 * getting the proper file system for deleting a path [#295](https://github.com/NICTA/scoobi/issues/295)
